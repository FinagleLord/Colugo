## Motivation

I got tired of looking at charts all day, so I 'found' a Colugo to do it for me.

## Requirements
+ [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
+ After Python is installed, click **requirements.bat** in the projects folder to install the required python dependencies.

## Installation or Getting Started

1st setup -- Add your Binance APIs keys to config.py, afterwards go to terminal and paste this in:

	python PATH_TO_COLUGO

replace **"PATH_TO_COLUGO"** with the path to main.py, going forward you can just click **run.bat** in the projects folder to start the bot :)
